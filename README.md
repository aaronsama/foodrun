# FoodRun, group food orders made simple

Our company lunch orders were hectic, so I made a simple little Rails app to help! Just enter what you're ordering and when you're going to call, and then share the unique URL via email or chat.

See some [discussion on Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/stories/49871-show-dn-group-lunch-orders-were-hectic-so-i-made-food-run).

Feel free to submit pull requests or issues, thanks!

## Example

Creating an order and adding items:

What an order looks like after expiring:
